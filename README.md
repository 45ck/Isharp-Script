# Mouse Script
Mouse Script is a lightweight application built in C++ that allows users to create simple scripts to automate various tasks on their computer. These scripts can be created using a simple and intuitive language, and can be run with just a single command.

Please note that I no longer actively develop this project and have not done any development work on it since 2018. The latest release has only been tested on Windows operating systems 8 and 10 and may not work on other operating systems.

## Features
- Varibles: Mouse Script allows users to define and use variables in their scripts. Variables can store strings, integers, and other data types.
- Functions: Mouse Script supports the creation and execution of custom functions. Functions can accept arguments and return values, allowing for more complex scripts.
- Conditional statements: Mouse Script supports if statements and other conditional logic, allowing users to create scripts that can make decisions and take different actions based on different conditions.
- Loops: Mouse Script supports looping constructs, allowing users to execute code multiple times in a row.
- Input/Output: Mouse Script allows users to read input from the user, display output to the console, and interact with the user through dialog boxes.
- System commands: Mouse Script allows users to execute system commands and interact with the operating system.

## Getting started
To get started with Mouse Script, simply download the application and run it from the command line. You can then create a script using the supported language and run it with the run command, followed by the path to the script file.

Here is an example of a simple script that displays a message to the user and asks for their input:

```php
:Main
$using = "Console";
Print "Please enter your name ";
$name = Input;
Print "Your name is: ";
Echo $name;
Pause;
```

For more information on the language and its supported features, please see the documentation.

## Contributions
Mouse Script is an open-source project and contributions are welcome. If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, please open an issue on the project's GitHub page.
